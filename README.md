## What's it Made With?
HTML, Javascript, and CSS

## How Does it Work?
Within the Javascript code, there is an array of question objects. Each object contains a question and all corresponding multiple-choice answers. These questions get shuffled and shown to the user. A question counter keeps track of the number of questions answered and uses that information to fill the meter accordingly. The question counter is reset to 0 once the quiz is completed and restarted. Want to practice your kana? Give it a try
